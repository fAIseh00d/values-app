  - ✅ Responsive design (desktop and mobile)
  - ✅ Mobile tooltips for card descriptions
  - ✅ Reset functionality to shuffle cards
  - ✅ **Cross-column drag-and-drop animations** - Cards now animate smoothly when moving between different columns
  - ✅ Build succeeds, dev server running on localhost:3000
  
- **What's in progress**: Testing and deployment
  
- **What's left**: 
  - Manual testing in browser (desktop and mobile views) - verify drag-and-drop animations and spill-over logic
  - Push to main and deploy to GitHub Pages
  
- **Known issues**: None currently.

- **Evolution**: Successfully built full-featured Values Card Sort web application with all planned features implemented. Fixed critical animation issue that prevented smooth cross-column dragging. Implemented robust spill-over logic that maintains perfect 11-card distribution across columns at all times.
