# Product Context

- **Why it exists**: To provide a digital version of Dr. Judy Ho's Values Card Sort exercise, making it accessible to anyone who wants to identify and prioritize their personal values without needing physical cards.
- **Problem solved**: The physical card sort requires printing and cutting 33 cards; this web app replicates the tactile sorting experience digitally with drag-and-drop, works on any device, and helps users reflect on their values to inform goal-setting and decision-making.
- **Expected behavior**: Users see an introductory modal explaining the exercise, then sort 33 value cards evenly across three columns (11 each) by dragging them. Cards auto-rearrange in a linked-list pattern (top-left to bottom-right). Mobile users get a responsive layout with tooltips for descriptions.
