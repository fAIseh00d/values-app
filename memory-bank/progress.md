# Progress

- **What works**: The base Next.js template builds and exports statically, and the GitHub Actions workflow deploys the generated `out/` directory to GitHub Pages every time changes hit `main`.
- **What’s left**: No active work; continue monitoring for additional pages or assets that require base path updates before each release.
- **Known issues**: None reported—the hosting is verified by the user and serves the site successfully via GitHub Pages.
- **Evolution**: The repository will continue to serve as a documented example for Next.js + GitHub Pages deployments, so keep the workflow and `next.config.ts` in sync with future feature additions.
