# Project Brief

- **Purpose**: A Values Card Sort web application based on Dr. Judy Ho's "Stop Self-Sabotage" exercise, deployed as a static Next.js site on GitHub Pages.
- **Scope**: Interactive card sorting app with 33 value cards organized across three columns (Most Important, Moderately Important, Least Important), with drag-and-drop functionality, responsive design, and GitHub Actions deployment pipeline.
- **Goal**: Help users identify and prioritize their personal values through an intuitive, tactile digital experience that mirrors the physical card sorting exercise, accessible on desktop and mobile devices.
